    He was the single child of Motilal Nehru and Swarup Rani Nehru. Nehru was one of the most renowned barristers and was known for his intellectual capabilities which soon made
     him one of the greatest politicians India had ever seen. Nehru, under the approval of Gandhi, his mentor, rose to become one of the most dominant figures in Indian politics from the 1930s onwards.
      Nehru, after much deliberations, 
    accepted the partition proposal for India in 1947 and took oath as the First Prime Minister of India after attaining independence. His birthday on 14 November is widely celebrated in India as Children’s day.</h4>
