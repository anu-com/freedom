   and a key member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. Without a doubt, he was one of the most revered figures of the Indian freedom struggle. 
   He collaborated closely with his colleagues Bhagat Singh and Shivram Rajguru. He was accused of being involved in the assassination of British officer John Saunders.
    Unfortunately, at the age of 24, he was caught and hanged with Bhagat Singh and Shivaram Rajguru on March 23, 1931, in Punjab's Hussainwala (now in Pakistan).
