                            He not only ushered India towards freedom, but he also became the inspiring figure for many independence struggles and rights movements across the world. Popularly called Bapu,
                             Gandhi introduced the doctrine of non-violence in India. According to him, independence was to be achieved through a combination of non-violent movement and non-co-operation with the British.
                              The historic Non-Cooperation movement, Dandi March and the Quit India movement were all started under his leadership.</h3>

                    <h3>Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer, 
                        politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the father of his country.
                         Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.
                    
                        In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them
                         a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only 
                         increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.</h3>
