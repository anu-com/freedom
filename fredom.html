             Gandhi introduced the doctrine of non-violence in India. According to him, independence was to be achieved through a combination of non-violent movement and non-co-operation with the British.
              The historic Non-Cooperation movement, Dandi March and the Quit India movement were all started under his leadership.</h2>

        He was a largely controversial, though respected figure in the freedom struggle of India. This revolutionary hero was born in a Sikh family in the undivided state of Punjab and carried the legacy of his 
        family and clinched to his patriotism till his death. He was involved in a plot in 1928 to assassinate James Scott, a British police superintendent to exact revenge for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai. 
        The plot failed when they mistakenly killed another young police officer and Singh fled to Lahore to escape from punishment. The following year, he, along with his associates hurled a bomb at the Central 
        Legislative Assembly in Delhi in protest against the implementation of the Defence of India Act and surrendered to the police. 
        This great Indian freedom fighter was sentenced to death by hanging by the British, and executed at the age of only 23.</h2>

         Bose. He was born on 23rd January 1897. He was a radical nationalist and his ultimate patriotism carved a hero out of him. Bose disagreed with the ideals of non-violence promoted by Gandhi, 
         instead of believing that only armed revolt could oust the British from India. The founder of the Forward Bloc, he escaped the eyes of the British to ultimately reach Germany during the second world war.
          He raised the Indian National Army (INA) and with Japanese help, was able to free a portion of Indian territory from the British in Manipur,
           but was ultimately defeated due to Japanese surrender to the British.
         Although he is believed to have died in a plane crash in 1945, his death remains shrouded in mystery to date.</h3>

   India Company's army's 34th Bengal Native Infantry (BNI) regiment, he led the sepoy mutiny, which eventually led to the 1857 uprising. When a new Enfield rifle was 
   launched in India in the mid-1850s, his biggest dispute with the business began. The rifle's cartridges were rumored to be lubricated with animal fat, specifically
    cow and pig fat. As a result of the cartridges' use, the Indian troops rebelled against the corporation since it violated their religious beliefs. Pandey and his
     fellow sepoys rose up in revolt against the British commanders on March 29, 1857, and even attempted to kill them. He was arrested and sentenced to death on 
     April 18. However, anticipating a sepoy uprising, British officials executed him 10 days prematurely on April 8.

  Ram Prasad Bismil was one of the most notable Indian revolutionaries who fought British colonialism and made it possible for the nation to breathe the air of 
  freedom after eons of struggle against the imperial forces, with a desire for freedom and revolutionary spirit reverberating in every inch of his body and poetry.
   Bismil, who was born in 1897, was a respected member of the Hindustan Republican Association alongside Sukhdev. He was also a participant in the infamous Kakori
    train heist, for which the British government condemned him to death.

   feminist and poet. A proponent of civil rights, women's emancipation, and anti-imperialistic ideas, she was an important person in India's struggle for independence from colonial rule. 
  She was also the first Indian woman to be the president of the Indian National Congress and to be appointed as governor of an Indian state (United Provinces)
  Naidu's literary work as a poet earned her the sobriquet the "Nightingale of India", or "Bharat Kokila" by Mahatma Gandhi because of colour, imagery and lyrical quality of her poetry.[2]

  Born in a Bengali family in Hyderabad, Chattopadhyay was educated in Madras, London and Cambridge. Following her time in England, where she worked as a suffragist, she was drawn to Indian National Congress' movement for India's independence from British rule. She became a part of the Indian nationalist movement and became a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and his idea of swaraj. She married Govindarajulu Naidu, a general physician in 1898. She was appointed the President of the Indian National Congress in 1925 and later became the Governor of the United Provinces in 1947, becoming the first woman to hold the office of Governor in the Dominion of India.
  
  Naidu's poetry includes both children's poems and others written on more serious themes including patriotism, and tragedy. Published in 1912, "In the Bazaars of Hyderabad" remains one of her most popular poems. She died of a cardiac arrest on 2 March 1949

He was a restaurant owner. Her mother Ambalika Devi was the daughter of Trailokyanath Sanyal, a renowned Brahmo leader who wrote many Brahmo hymns. Upendranath Ganguly's younger brother Dhirendranath Ganguly (DG) was one of the earliest film directors.[3] Another brother, Nagendranath, was a university professor who married Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore's only surviving daughter Mira Devi.[4] Aruna's sister Purnima Banerjee was a member of the Constituent Assembly of India.

  Aruna was educated at Sacred Heart Convent in Lahore and then at All Saints' College in Nainital. After her graduation, she worked as a teacher at the Gokhale Memorial School in Calcutta. She met Asaf Ali, a leader in the Congress party, in Allahabad. They got married in 1928, despite parental opposition on grounds of religion and age (he was a Muslim and her senior by more than 20 years).[5]
  
  My father was no more when Asaf and I married in September 1928. My paternal uncle Nagendranath Ganguly, a university professor who regarded himself as my guardian, said to relatives and friends that as far as he was concerned I was dead and he had performed my shraddh.[6]

<div style="background-color: rgb(190, 209, 198);color:black;padding: 10; margin: 10px,10PX,10PX,10PX;"><h4>Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit (nee Swarup Nehru;[2] 18 August 1900 - 1 December 1990) was an Indian diplomat
   and politician who was the 6th Governor of Maharashtra from 1962 to 1964 and 8th President of the United Nations General Assembly from 1953 to 1954, the first woman appointed to either post. Hailing
    from a prominent political family, her brother Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister of independent India, her niece Indira Gandhi the first female Prime Minister of India and her grand-nephew 
    Rajiv Gandhi was the sixth Prime Minister of India. Despite her minimal education ( she was schooled entirely at home), Nehru showered her with diplomatic favours, sending Pandit to London as India's 
    most important diplomat after serving as india's envoy to the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Nations. Her time in London offers insights
     into the wider context of changes in Indo-British relations. Her
   High-Commissionership was a microcosm of inter-governmental relations. Critics described her as a 'poisoned dwarf', both vicious and greedy, noting a voracious sexual appetite that extended to married Indian men</h4>
