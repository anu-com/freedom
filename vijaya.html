<div style="background-color: rgb(190, 209, 198);color:black;padding: 10; margin: 10px,10PX,10PX,10PX;"><h4>Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit (nee Swarup Nehru;[2] 18 August 1900 - 1 December 1990) was an Indian diplomat
   and politician who was the 6th Governor of Maharashtra from 1962 to 1964 and 8th President of the United Nations General Assembly from 1953 to 1954, the first woman appointed to either post. Hailing
    from a prominent political family, her brother Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister of independent India, her niece Indira Gandhi the first female Prime Minister of India and her grand-nephew 
    Rajiv Gandhi was the sixth Prime Minister of India. Despite her minimal education ( she was schooled entirely at home), Nehru showered her with diplomatic favours, sending Pandit to London as India's 
    most important diplomat after serving as india's envoy to the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Nations. Her time in London offers insights
     into the wider context of changes in Indo-British relations. Her
   High-Commissionership was a microcosm of inter-governmental relations. Critics described her as a 'poisoned dwarf', both vicious and greedy, noting a voracious sexual appetite that extended to married Indian men</h4>
