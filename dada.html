   Philosophy professor. He was educated at the Elphinstone College in Bombay. He turned towards politics later in life and became very active in the field.
    His opinion was unfavourable and he felt that the British rule would leave and cause irreparable damage to the Indian economy. 
    In the years 1886, 1893 and 1906, Dadabhai Naoroji had the privilege of presiding over the annual sessions of the Indian National Congress.
     This later led to the nationalist movement in India. His popular writings include the article named Poverty and Un-British Rule in India (1901). 
  In this article, he was of the strong belief and opinion that India was taxed at a very high rate and all of Indiaâ€™s wealth was being drained to England.</h4>
