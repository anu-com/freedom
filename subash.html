         Bose. He was born on 23rd January 1897. He was a radical nationalist and his ultimate patriotism carved a hero out of him. Bose disagreed with the ideals of non-violence promoted by Gandhi, 
         instead of believing that only armed revolt could oust the British from India. The founder of the Forward Bloc, he escaped the eyes of the British to ultimately reach Germany during the second world war.
          He raised the Indian National Army (INA) and with Japanese help, was able to free a portion of Indian territory from the British in Manipur,
           but was ultimately defeated due to Japanese surrender to the British.
         Although he is believed to have died in a plane crash in 1945, his death remains shrouded in mystery to date.</h4>
